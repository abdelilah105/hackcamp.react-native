# HackJam 2 - redux

## Start

### Install

In a terminal, execute
```
yarn
```

## Part 1 - Redux

### Use

In a terminal, execute
```
yarn test
```

### TODO

* Write the reducers
* Write the actions
* Implement tests for the filter reducer

Once all your tests are green, you're good to go for part 2 ;-)

## Part 2 - React Redux

### Use
Launch Expo XDE and open the app.



### TODO
* Fix the errors
* The list of trucks seems to be empty ...
* Make sure that all the components get the right props from connect()
* The HeaderWidget button does not work...


## Bonus
- Add the delete function in the trucks tests, implement it in the reducer and then implement it in the app
